# Squares Scoreboard
## Competitive points-based quiz scoreboard
Reinforce learning with FUN! Created by educators for educators, Squares is a fun, competitive, team-based quiz game for use in the classroom. Teams pick any letter on the board to reveal the amount of points they win. After all the squares are gone, the winning team is the one with the most points.

Squares is simple for a teacher to moderate. Optimized for 1024x768 screens, Squares is ideal for projection. The game can be controlled with a mouse or with the keyboard (this is ideal). Press "1" or "2" to toggle between teams and press any letter to add/remove a square with its points to that team. For added fun, press "+" once to double the remaining points on the board and again to triple.

Every game is different. Pre-defined point values ranging from 0 - 2000 are assigned randomly to the squares. Want to start a new game? Just refresh the page for more fun!
